### Introduction
[Ribbits n' Rockets](https://github.com/Ribbits-n-Rockets) is a game developed in the CIS 464: Computer Game Design course offered at UMass Dartmouth. Development and progress on the game was overseen by Dr. Firas Khatib and feedback was routinely collected by colleagues. 

The goal of each level of Ribbits n' Rockets is to traverse to the checkered flag a the end of each level. To do so, you must dodge hazards such as spikes, cannons, and sawblades, while utilizing your ability to rocket jump to span far distances and climb tall heights.
### Gameplay contents
The primary mechanic of Ribbits n' Rockets is the rocket jump. Holding down the space bar will charge up an increasingly powerful jump that, upon release, shoots the player a large distance both horizontally and vertically. When charging the jump, a UI element is displayed on the side, showing the amount of power currently stored in the jump.

You'll have to be careful as you navigate the levels, as each one is filled with deadly hazards that will immediately send you back to the start of the level should you succumb to them.

Remember to utilize the speed and freedom of movement you're provided, as it will greatly aid you in your quest to reach the top of each level. Deftly dodging projectiles and narrowly threading gaps will be a common occurrence as you escape the laboratory.
